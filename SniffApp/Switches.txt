Switch Explanation file
------------------------------------------------------------------
Switches Needed:
*Case sensitivity switch (optional, case sensitive by default)
	1. -c
		2. since the user would probably use this to make it case insensitive, no argument is needed
*search start switch (needs argument of pathname, cwd at default)
	1. --root [pathname] / -r [pathname]
		2. Using root since the given directory name would be the base/root of the search.
*output switch (needs output file argument, screen output at default.)
	1. -o [filename]
*verbose switch
	1. --verbose -v
		2. print the name of every file and directory that is opened.
*help switch
	1. --help
